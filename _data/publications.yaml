  summary: "Using 1,585 de-identified letters of recommendation (~919k tokens), my thesis combines Word2Vec and fine-tuned Mistral-7B embeddings to measure gender-directional framing via bias axes, WEAT-style tests, and analogy probes. It turns long-standing concerns about biased LoR language into quantitative metrics that can be used for reviewer calibration, dashboards, and faculty workshops to support fairer admissions and evaluations."
